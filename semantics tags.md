A consistent, clean & tidy HTMl code makes it easier for others to read and understand your code. In order to achieve that it is good to follow the guidelines.

Why are best practices important?
If you follow best practices, working with your code will be easier  for yourself & for other developers as well.

In order to do best practcies lets talk about Semantic Tags.
Semantic Tags introduced in HTML 5 that allows developers to more accurately describe the relationship between HTML elements on a webpage. For example, instead of using (div) tags to group elements we can use (header), (nav) or (section) tags depending on what specific type of group of elements we are trying to make.

Why are semantic tags important?
using semantic tags does not chnage the appearance of the website in the browser , but its important to use them as semantic tags more accurately describe the content that is on the page. Describing the contents of the page more semantically can have many benefits, such as;
- Making code easier for people to navigate when updating features or fixing bugs.
- Giving your page a higher Search Engine Optimization (SEO) score
- Allowing users with special needs to access your website using alternative means such as screen readers.

Each HTML element behaves like a box that has the following properties:
- Content Width
- Content Height
- Padding (top, left, bottom, right)
- border
- margin

Lets do some discussion about the Box Model. Understanding the box model and what properties can change the appearance of an HTML element can enable you to style HTML elements with CSS quickly and easily without having to attempt trial-and-error changes.
If trial-and-error does become necessary, it can be done using the browser's developer tools that make it easier to visualize the relationship between different HTML elements.
